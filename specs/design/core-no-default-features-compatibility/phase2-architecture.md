# Phase 2: Solution and Architecture

## Evidence and Decision

The resolution records unconditional async-store dependencies and a compatibility feature. The source therefore has no independent solution boundary to design. This record points implementers to `specs/design/core-no-default-features/` and deliberately omits Phases 3 and 4.

## Risk Review

| Risk | Assessment | Containment |
|---|---|---|
| Reopening a finished design | Historical decisions could be contradicted. | Do not modify `core-no-default-features`; retain this separate coverage record only. |
| Duplicate implementation | A later reader could plan the closed work twice. | Source `design:` links here and this record names the covering design. |
| Stale status | A source could look actionable despite its resolution. | Preserve its closed status and documented evidence. |

## Feasibility

No new Rust ownership, async, serialization, or error-path change is proposed. The completed covering design is the implementation authority.
